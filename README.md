# AutoLevels

AutoLevels is a program for batch-processing images to fix common issues in a semi- or fully-automated fashion.

## Purpose

When you encounter images scanned from analog film or poorly processed by automatic corrections, such as "backlight" or simply underexposed, you will find black/white points that are too high/low. Even worse, they can differ by channel and produce a weird glow in dark areas or color cast on the entire image. Photo editing apps typically have features like "autolevel" or "enhance contrast" that could be used in batch-processing. They set black and white points to zero and 255, respectively. These might overshoot the problem, and the result may appear unnatural, particularly if the original image has low contrast. They are also not very suitable for fixing color problems.

AutoLevels helps you fix these issues by letting you choose sensible target black/white points for a batch of images. It detects low-contrast images and treats them differently. Along the way, you can remove a constant color cast, change gamma and saturation. If your color cast or bad camera settings require a more complex curve correction, AutoLevels has you covered: try the AI-based free curve correction, which finds the optimal RGB curves for each image.

## Features

- Adjust black point, white point, gamma, and saturation
- Fully automated curve-based color correction feature
- Smooth/Histogram/Perceptive black/white point sampling
- Automatically detect low-contrast images and apply sensible corrections
- Export darktable XMP files for a professional non-destructive workflow
- Support for 16/48-bit images (TIFF, PNG)
- Apply ICC color profiles *after* corrections
- Flexible definition of input/output files (glob pattern, prefix/suffix, Python f-string)
- Preserves compression quality and metadata (EXIF, ICC-profile)
- Free Open Source Software (GPLv3)

## Installation

If you have Python 3.9 or later installed on a Linux or MacOS machine, open a shell and execute:

```bash
pip install autolevels
```

This will install the current stable release. To get the latest version from the github repository (requires git), use

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yellowdolphin/autolevels.git
```

This will also install the following requirements if not found:

- numpy
- pillow
- piexif
- opencv-python
- h5py
- onnxruntime

To use the fully automated curve correction feature, download the [ONNX curve inference model](https://retroshine.eu/download/free_xcittiny_wa14.onnx)
and specify the downloaded .onnx file using the `--model` option:

```bash
autolevels --model ~/Downloads/free_xcittiny_wa14.onnx -- example.jpg
```

## Graphical User Interface

If you prefer a graphical user interface, you can checkout [RetroShine](https://retroshine.eu), which provides a user-friendly interface for AutoLevels.

## Documentation

### Basic Usage

```bash
autolevels --blackpoint 10 --whitepoint 255 --gamma 1.1 -- example.jpg
```

This will process the file `example.jpg` and write the output to `example_al.jpg` using the default suffix "`_al`". You can change that with `--outsuffix <my suffix>` or specify an output folder with `--outdir`. See **Batch Processing** for more ways to define input and output file names. 

You can either use the fully automated correction with the `--model` option **or** manually specify target values for the black and white points of your images with the `--blackpoint` and `--whitepoint` options. In the latter case, you can further adjust the scope of the correction by setting bounds for images with low contrast. 

Get a description of all options with:

```bash
autolevels -h
```

Safely try out settings before writing any output files with `--simulate` or `--sandbox`. You can check file names, black/white point correction, as images are read and processed, but not saved.

```bash
autolevels --simulate --blackpoint 10 5 0 --mode perceptive -- *.jpg
```

### Batch Processing

The power of batch processing lets you apply the same corrections to a batch of images with a common capture source, camera settings, lighting conditions, or any common issue that can be fixed in a semi-automated fashion. If you don't have the time or expertise to find the optimal parameters, you can leverage AI power using the `--model` option. This will correct each image with individual RGB curves, fully automatic, correcting color casts, bad exposure, or white balance settings on the fly.

This leaves you with defining input and output files and paths. AutoLevels gives you three ways to do that.

1. **Folders and glob patterns**

   ```bash
   autolevels --outdir processed -- scans/*.png IMG_00[0-3]?.jpg
   ```

   Your shell will interpret these glob patterns and expand the file names to `scans/12.png scans/23.png IMG_0015.jpg ...` matching any existing files in the current directory. All output files are written to the specified folder `processed`.

   If you are afraid the expanded list of file paths exceeds the shell limit for the length of a command, you can specify a folder for the input files and enter the glob pattern in quotes to escape shell expansion:

   ```bash
   autolevels --folder ~/Pictures/scans -- "*.tif"
   ```

2. **Prefixes and Suffixes**
   Often, your input file names will have a common folder, prefix, suffix, and some variable part in between. You may want to keep the variable part and change any of the fixed components, for example:

   ```bash
   autolevels --folder orig --prefix scn --suffix .jpg --outfolder processed --outprefix img_ --outsuffix .jpg -- 1 2 3 4
   ```

   This will search for input files `orig/scn1.jpg ...` and write output files `processed/img_1.jpg ...`

3. **Python f-strings**
   An alternative way to define file names in AutoLevels is to use Python f-strings. Don't worry, no Python skills required, just look at this example:

   ```python
   variable = 42
   f"orig/scn_{variable:04d}.jpg"
   ```

   This is proper Python code and evaluates to "orig/scn_0042.jpg". The part in curly brackets contains a variable name and (after the `:`) an optional format instruction for integer numbers `d`, which shall have leading `0`s to make `4` digits.

   If you provide an f-string to the `--fstring` or `--outfstring` options (you can skip the "f" before the quotes), AutoLevels substitutes `variable` by any values given instead of file names:

   ```bash
   autolevels --fstring "orig/scn{i}.jpg" --outfstring "processed/img_{i:04d}.jpg" -- 1 2 3
   ```

   This will read files `orig/scn1.jpg ...` and write `processed/img_0001.jpg ...` to disk.

### Exporting darktable XMP files

You can use AutoLevels as an automatic preprocessing step in a non-destructive workflow using [darktable](https://www.darktable.org). The idea is to establish a baseline color correction with the `--model` option and export the curves to darktable, where you can fine-tune them or proceed with your normal darktable workflow.

The recommended way to use AutoLevels curves in darktable is to install the [darktable-autolevels-module](https://github.com/yellowdolphin/darktable-autolevels-module) Lua script, which you can activate via the _scripts_ module in the lighttable view. An _AutoLevels_ module will appear in the same panel. Click the little file browser button to search for the downloaded .onnx file. Then select images and press the "add AutoLevels curve" button. Changing to the darkroom, you will find a new history item that adds an _rgb curve_ instance in mode "RGB, independent channels". Feel free to make adjustments to the curves, the original curves will remain in the history.

You might notice that the _rgb curve_ instance created by AutoLevels is applied right before the _input color profile_ module. This is where the channel-wise color correction works most effectively for JPEGs and most HDR images (RAW formats are not yet supported by the script). If you create a new _rgb curve_ instance, this will appear at the usual place in the pipeline.

Under the hood, the Lua script calls `autolevels` with the `--export darktable <version>` argument:

```bash
autolevels --model ~/Downloads/free_xcittiny_wa14.onnx --export darktable 5.3.0 --outsuffix .jpg.xmp -- myimage.jpg
```

AutoLevels reads the XMP sidecar file associated with each selected image (or duplicate). It is passed via the `--outsuffix` option. If the XMP file does not exist, AutoLevels will create a minimal one with the default auto-apply presets. The `--outsuffix` option is optional and prevents AutoLevels from creating an output image if its value ends with ".xmp".

If you want to call AutoLevels with the `--export darktable` option outside of darktable, note that darktable only reads XMP files on import if you have activated the `look for updated XMP files on startup` option in preferences/storage.
