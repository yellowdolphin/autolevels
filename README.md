AutoLevels is a script for batch-processing images to fix most common errors in a smart and semi-automated fashion.

Features:
- Adjust black- and white-points, gamma, saturation
- Find perceptive rather than numeric black/white-points
- Automatically detect low-contrast images and apply sensible corrections
